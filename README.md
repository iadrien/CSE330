# CSE332 Object-Oriented Software Development Lab
##### Labs built upon previous labs towards several card games

## How to Run
### To compile, use Visual Studio. To run the executable program, enter the command line as follows separated by space:

#####    Game Name, Player 1’s Name, Player 2’s Name, More Players’ Names (optional)

##### Game name: FiveCardDraw, SevenCardStud, or TexasHoldEm.

##### Players names: combinations of alphanumeric characters that represent players. If followed by a star, the player will discard cards and leave the game automatically. “NO” “No” “nO” “no, ” either followed or not followed by a star, are not allowed.

## How to Play

#### FiveCardDraw has two betting phases, one before discarding cards and another after. The program will first print out five cards that a player has and ask whether to discard or not. When entering the card indices to discard, all integers should be in the same line. The program will then print out player information twice, the first one in order of the time by which they join the game while the second one by their hands’ rank.

#### SevenCardStud has five turns of dealing cards and five betting phases after each one of them. Cards that are dealt facing down will only be visible until the end of round. Before that, a player can see his/her own cards but not others’.

#### TexasHoldEm has four turns of dealing cards and four betting phases after each one of them. Unlike the previous games, it has five cards shared by all players.

#### After a round, we ask if any player wants to leave or join. The input should be a player’s name per line until a “no. ” If a player runs out of chips, this is the time the program asks whether to reset it to 20. Then player data are stored as local files with four lines that contains name, wins, losses, and chips respectively.
