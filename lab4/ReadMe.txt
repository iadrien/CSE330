CSE 332 Lab  4: Multiple Card Games
-------------------------------------
Team members: Cindy Le, Yanni Yang and Adrien Xie
=====================================
INSTRUCTION TO PLAY

To run the test, enter the command line as follows separated by space:

[Game Name] [Player 1’s Name] [Player 2’s Name] [More Players’ Names (optional)]

Game name : FiveCardDraw or SevenCardStud
Players names: combinations of alphanumeric characters that represent players. 
If followed by a star (*), the player will discard cards and leave the game automatically. 
“NO” “No” “nO” “no, ” either followed or not followed by “*”, are not allowed.

FiveCardDraw has two betting phases, one before discarding cards and another after. 
The program will first print out five cards that a player has and ask whether to discard or not. 
When entering the card indices to discard, all integers should be in the same line. 
The program will then print out player information twice, the first one in order of the time by 
which they join the game while the second one by their hands’ rank.

SevenCardStud has five turns of dealing cards and five betting phases after each one of them. 
Cards that are dealt facing down will only be visible until the end of round. 
Before that, a player can see his/her own cards but not others’.

After a round, we ask if any player wants to leave or join. 
The input should be a player’s name per line until a “no. ”
If a player runs out of chips, this is the time the program asks whether to reset it to 20. 
Then player data are stored as local files with four lines that contains name, wins, losses, and
chips respectively. 

Note: In this lab, we ignore autoplayers that we did for extra credit of last time.

=====================================

In this lab we implemented a new game, SevenCardStud, which shares many features with 
FiveCardDraw. We created an intermediate class PokerGame deriving from Game class and
moved many functions from FiveCardDraw to PokerGame to keep consistency of the subclasses. 

We realized that before_round() and round() were different from game to game, so we made
them virtual in PokerGame and depend on implementation in subclasses. In after_round(), the
program sorts players by findMaxHash() in Hand.cpp, a function picking the five cards that gives
a highest rank. Because it applies to any players with five or more cards, the two games can
share the same function in PokerGame. We also renamed before_turn(), turn(), and after_turn() in
PokerGame based on their functional effects.

Besides structural adjustment, we added betting phases to the games by using bet_in_turn(). It
reads from command line input the number of chips and records it in member variable “bet” of
each player. At the end of the round, these chips are either returned to players who win the game,
or added to the pot that will then be shared by winners of the round.

As for hiding card contents, we defined an enum of visibility for each cards. When asking the
program to print cards, we will specify access mode of enum that tells toString() what to hide from
outstream.

Header/Source Files Newly Created:
PokerGame.h            PokerGame.cpp
SevenCardStud.h      SevenCardStud.cpp

Header/Source Files with Significant Modifications: 
FiveCardDraw.h        FiveCardDraw.cpp
Game.h                     Game.cpp
Hand.h                      Hand.cpp

For more information, please see comments in the .h and .cpp files.

-------------------------------------

While building the file, we got the following errors:

C4018: '>=' : signed/unsigned mismatch
Caused by comparing an int with a size_t
Fixed by changing both sides of the equation to variables of size_t

Once the program was built successfully, we got the following errors:

After entered a new game name, the program continues to execute the old one.
Caused by not properly resetting the game pointer to the new game.
Fixed by adding reset() for the pointer.

The member variable “pot” in the class PokerGame got crazily big ( e. g. 42972579 )
Caused by the subtracting an unsigned int variable out of boundary. 
Fixed by correcting the function betChip().

User are suggested all-in unnecessarily.
Caused by incorrect checking on the player bet and the number of chips needed for call.
Fixed by correcting the check statement

Then the program runs and outputs as expected without errors or warnings. 
Some trial results are appended at the end of this file. 

=====================================
Error Code

0 Successful run. 
1 An unknown error has occurred. 
2 No Sufficient command line arguments are given. 
3 Too many command line arguments are given. 
4 More than five cards are in the hand. 
5 The deck has nothing to pop up. 
6 Hand's index is out of range.
7 The hand contains less than five cards.
8 The function only applies to five cards.
9 The hand contains two cards of same suit.
10 Instance is not available! 
11 Game is already started!
12 Unknown game! 
13 No game is currently in process! 
14 There is an issue with the pot. 
15 The player is already playing! 
16 No player is unfolded.
17 No player wins this round.
18 No enough players are currently in this round.
19 The decks have no cards to deal.

=======================================
Extra Credit

We defined a new class TexasHoldEm for a new game that has four turns of dealing cards and
four betting phases after each one of them. Unlike the previous games, it has five cards shared
by all players. 

To make this work, we defined an extra function in PokerGame that pops up a card the proper
deck and then adds it to every player’s hand. Then we changed the Game class so that it could
recognize “TexasHoldEm” as a game name.
